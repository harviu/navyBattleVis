She served alongside German heavy cruisers at Málaga to evacuate their respective nationals out of Spain.  She returned to Boston Navy Yard on 5 Oct 1936, and in the following spring she completed her final trials.  She was re-assigned to the Pacific Fleet's Cruiser Division 7; she left Boston on 12 Apr and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 May.  After engaging in several exercises, she spent some time at Mare Island Navy Yard for an overhaul, then headed back for the Atlantic.  She participated in the Good Will Tour to South American 10 Apr-12 Jun 1939.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>After Germany launched its invasion of Poland, USS Quincy was sent to North Atlantic for Neutrality Patrols. Early 1941 saw her in the Caribbean, then mid-Atlantic until Jun 1941.  She served in the Atlantic with carriers Wasp and Yorktown.  On 28 Jul 1941, she sailed with Task Force 16 to Iceland, then headed for patrols in the Denmark Straits during the end of Sep.  Later in 1941, she escorted a convoy from Capetown back to Trinidad in the Caribbean Islands.  She spent the first half of 1942 back in the North Atlantic, then returned to the United States for an overhaul at New York Navy Yard in May 1942.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>On 19 Jun 1942, USS Quincy arrived at San Diego and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Norman Scott of Task Force 18.  From there she departed for the South Pacific in Jul to support the invasion of Guadalcanal.  She arrived in the area in the first week of Aug, and participated in preliminary shelling of the Japanese-held island on 7 Aug; in the shelling she destroyed several Japanese installations and an oil depot at Lunga Point.  When the American Marines made the landing, she also provided gun support.  During the early hours of 9 Aug 1942, while on patrol off Savo Island north of Guadalcanal, her force was surprise attacked by Admiral Gunichi Mikawa's force.  When the attacking Japanese cruisers trained their searchlights on Quincy, Quincy's guns were still trained.  She was caught between two columns of Japanese cruisers and received a pounding.  "We're going down between them - give them hell!" said Captain Moore of Quincy.  She fought valiantly, but was not able to overcome the heavy firing from the Japanese cruisers.  She capsized and sank at about 0235 that day, becoming one of the first ships that eventually nicknamed that area of the water "Ironbottom Sound".  370 lives were lost aboard Quincy during the Battle of Savo Island, and 167 were wounded.</p>

Lt. Arthur Gutman and Private John Commers. They may have been in the same unit as both were assigned to Anti-Aircfraft duties. I know that Lt. Gutman was killed prior to the ship sinking, as per a Captain that was a witness, but am not sure about Private Commers. I know that their parents had one Hell of a time getting their benefits out of the Marine Corps. based upon copies of their service records and that is one sad fact that I wished I had not known about. It was over a year before their parents were told about their deaths. I can only imagine the agony they went through as I have seen copies of the letters that went back and forth from the War Department to them. Not only were they kept in the dark about the deaths, the War Department did not inform the parents about what benefits were due them and what $$$ they had in their savings accounts, etc. and had to get their U.S. Reps. involved to get the information for them. I know that in 1942 we were getting our butts kicked by the superior firepower and technology of the Japanese and the government did not want the public to know that but there is no excuse for this type of treatment to the survivors. The parents are long deceased now but i would like to get as much information about this event for their families to make sure they know these brave men did not die in vain. I assume they are resting on the bottom of " Iron Bottom Sound " and I plan on going there to drop some flowers over the wreck site before I die. I was born almost 6 years after their deaths and Private Commers' family were neighbors for several years and they never talked about it and the first time I saw his photo in an old WWII newspaper marked
" lost at sea ", his face has haunted me ever since and I was probably only age 6 at the time.
This event should be made into a movie as all three heavy cruisers went down. 
SEMPER FI and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU forever and May GOD bless you. 
Thank you very very much for your service to our country and the payment of the ultimate sacrifice.     </div><div id='commentItem8' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>8. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Janet Peterson</span> says:<br /><small>11 Nov 2013 02:21:46 PM</small><br /><br />My dad Howard Phifer was a survivor of the 1942 sinking of the Quincy. I was born in 1961 and my father never talked about the war; but it affected him for the rest of his life. He died in 1987 when he was 70. I would like to find someone who my have been told about him or maybe even knew him at that time, although I know that's unlikely. I believe he was chief bosents mate and would have been 25 at the time. Also his last name may be mispelled as "Pieffer". I'm having a hard time finding crew information. I do know that he was in the third division,they were known as "the fighting third".  </div><div id='commentItem9' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>9. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Adrian Ringus</span> says:<br /><small>21 Apr 2014 07:21:14 PM</small><br /><br />RINGUS, JULIAN G	2125289 USN	BM2	 08/09/1942

This veteran, DeWitt Talmadge Van Dyke died aboard the USS Quincy on August 1942. People who are looking for info should check the microfilm of old local newspapers if at all possible. This was one of the articles I found on DeWitt T. Van Dyke. D.T. VAN DYKE, JR., MISSING IN ACTION, NAVY REPORTS

A message was received over the week-end by Mr. and Mrs. DeWitt Van Dyke, Sr., of Effingham, from Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, stating that their son, DeWitt Van Dyke Jr., boilermaker first-class in the U.S. Navy, who was reported missing in action August 9, 1943, was killed in action during a major sea battle of Guadalcanal. Van Dyke was aboard the cruiser U.S.S. Quincy at the time of his death. Van Dyke, who was 23 years of age, was a graduate of Effingham high school and had enlisted in the Navy in the fall of 1938. Besides his parents, he leaves one brother, Logan Van Dyke of Effingham, and one sister, Odessa at home.

My father survived the ordeal but Charlie Quinton did not. My father was well along in years before he told the story of that terrible attack. This is what he related to me- everyone knew the attack was coming and that last night he and his brother and some shipmates sat on the fantail and talked about their families and what  they felt about the possibility of dying--they had been taking men into battle (the marines they had transported) and they knew death was all around. There was lots of conversation about their orders- they were floating around the islands "making lazy eights" waiting for the Japanese Navy to show up but the commanders were certain they wouldn't be in til at least dawn-so they had plenty of time- the men he was with weren't so optimistic. When the shooting started, they weren't prepared. Everyone ran to his station but most of the guns didn't even get off a round.  My Dad's gun station did manage to fire several rounds- he said they were pulling up the shells looking down at fires below them- he thought he saw the explosion that wiped out Charlie Quinton's turret but he kept working. When the abandon ship call was made, he walked  to the bin where the life jackets were kept (apparently then you didn't wear it til you needed it ?)he said the ship was listing badly by that time and the dead and injured were everywhere but mostly everyone  he saw was dead. He said he walked to the rail and because the ship was sinking so rapidly, just walked off into the water. He said the fighting was still going on all around them and the men in the water tried to get away from the ship which was burning and going down fast. What seemed like forever was over in a moment and then the waiting began. The men knew they had lost this battle and lost it bad so they didn't know what would happen. They tried to stay together and not drift off. Before long the shelling was over and they began to hope for rescue. Suddenly they  heard gunfire and their first thought was the Japanese sailors were shooting the American survivors in the water.  They tried to swim away but the boats kept coming. Finally they heard American voices telling them to swim to them, there are sharks in the water and they can't hold them off. My Dad was picked up and taken aboard another ship. It was there  the deaths of his bother,captain and may shipmates were confirmed.</div><div id='commentItem15' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>15. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Ann Lightbody</span> says:<br /><small>16 Apr 2016 05:35:47 PM</small><br /><br />I'm looking for information on my Great Uncle Joseph Dietz who was on board the USS Quincy went it went down on August 9, 1942.

The Quincy Muster Rolls list a Joseph Walter Corliss, service number 223 41 12, who enlisted 6 Oct 1937 in Brooklyn NY and was received aboard Quincy 9 Mar 1938 as a Seaman 2nd-class. He left the ship as a Fire Controlman 2nd-class 13 Oct 1941 due to being Honorably Discharged at the end of his enlistment.
