She was commissioned in December 1917, and operated in the western Atlantic area until July 1919, when she transited the Panama Canal to the Pacific. Over more than a decade, she operated with the fleet's other battleships, conducting exercises and training operations in the Pacific and in the Caribbean. During gunnery practice on 12 June 1924, she suffered a turret fire that took the lives of 48 of her crew. Mississippi steamed to Australia on a U.S. Fleet good will tour in mid-1925.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>During 1931-33 , Mississippi underwent a major modernization that gave her an all-new superstructure, improved armament and enhanced protection. She returned to the Pacific in October 1934 to resume her earlier pattern of regular exercises, Fleet Problems and training. In June 1941, in response to the deteriorating war situation in Europe, she was brought back to the Atlantic, operating between the United States and Iceland during much of the rest of that year.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>In early 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mississippi rejoined the Pacific Fleet. She spent most of 1942 along the U.S. west coast and went to the South Pacific late in that year. In 1943, she took part operations against Kiska Island, in the Aleutians, and in the capture of the Gilbert Islands. During the latter operation, on 29 November 1943, Mississippi experienced another turret explosion, which took 43 lives. Following repairs, she participated in the capture of Kwajalein in February 1944 and bombarded Japanese-held islands in February and March. Later in the year, she was part of the force that invaded Peleliu and Leyte and defeated a Japanese task force in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Mississippi provided gunfire support for the Lingayen landings in January 1945 and for the conquest of Okinawa in March-June. The battleship was damaged by suicide planes in both operations. She was present in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, when Japan formally surrendered and returned to the United States soon thereafter.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Mississippi was converted to a gunnery training and weapons development ship in 1946, and given the new hull number AG-128. In this role, she carried a variety of old and new guns and radars, while serving with the Operational Development Force in the Atlantic. During the mid-1950s, she was test ship for the Navy's first surface-to-air guided missile, the "Terrier". Decommissioned in September 1956, USS Mississippi was sold for scrapping in November of that year, after almost forty years of service.</p>

I live near Bremerton WA where it was serviced for a short time during the war.  They have a very nice Naval Museum.  I plan to donate some of his memorabilia that he saved from his time on this battle ship.  It's great history for us all to know about.  I look at some of the pictures I have of the crew and it was a ship full of very young men.  They went through an awful lot, we could never imagine.  </div><div id='commentItem6' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>6. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Olivia</span> says:<br /><small>18 May 2011 05:38:25 PM</small><br /><br />My father served on the USS Mississippi from September 1942 to December 1945, where upon discharge his rating was Gunner's Mate 3C.

I believe that he had a friend that he spoke of by the name of Jim Hutenlocker.<<(spelling??) I remember him saying how he loved "The Missi".

He was responsible for loading Turret #3 seeing that the breech was clear and there was no fire in the chamber when they shoved in the new powder loads, wrapped in asbestos and fire in the breech is what caused the #2 turret to explode on the ship.

The documents you seek are called War Diaries and are available digitally at Fold3.com (for a price) or on paper from the National Archives for free (or nearly so). I have looked at Fold3 and BB41s War Diaries from New Years 1945 to VJ-Day amount to about 40 pages.

He shared many stories that not only touch my heart but confirms that his generation deserves the statement of "The Greatest Generation That Ever Lived". I am blessed to have had the chance to listen to a incredible interview his grandaughter convinced him to do more than 20 years ago.

He worked in the soda fountain and cleaners. He only would tell a few stories about how he would make extra money cleaning uniforms (after bar room fights during leave) so they could pass inspection the next morning.  He also said a buddy and him had a station wagon in Florida that they would haul shipmates to Norfolk.  Other story was during a trip through the pacffic, they passed through a typhoon where the waves were hitting the conning tower and the rudder system failed, he said there was vomit and foot prints on the passage way walls before it was all over

Didn't talk about it much and his war history came onlY  in fragments.  My mom and he were married at St Louis Cathedral, New Orleans, when they ship docked there at the end of the war.  Mom made him shave off his long black beard when they got to port!!  I would very much enjoy communicating with any of you regarding the ship during WWII.  HAPPY VETERAN'S DAY 2016!

I have the actual and authentic Scoreboard  painted on the USS Mississippi showing the "stamps" you mention. My father Donald LeRoy Lawrence, Shipfitter, 3rd Class, from Chula Vista, CA, served from 6-28-43 until 2-24-46. One of the  proud and incredibly brave young men who 'gave it all' for their country and for us. How I pray you see this message!! <br />Dona Meier</div><small><p>All visitor submitted comments are opinions of those making the submissions and do not reflect views of WW2DB.</p></small>	<script>
