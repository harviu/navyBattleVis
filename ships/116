She was sent to the Pacific Ocean, participating in the strike on Rabaul, New Britain on 11 Nov 1943 six months after her commissioning.  She then took part in the Gilbert Islands invasion, an attack on Kavieng in New Ireland, the Marshall Islands invasion, the carrier raid on Truk in the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands invasion, and many raids on Japanese bases across the Pacific Ocean.  On 6 Nov 1944, she entered a period of maintenance and repairs at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington, United States, and did not return to combat until 24 Jan 1945.  In Feb 1945, she launched aircraft to support the Iwo Jima invasion.  Later that month, Bunker Hill's aircraft raided the Japanese home islands.  In Apr 1945, she supported the Okinawa invasion, where her aircraft was involved in the sinking of the battleship Yamato.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>On 11 May 1945, while off Okinawa, Bunker Hill was struck by two <i>kamikaze</i> special attack aircraft.  The first was a Zero fighter, whose 250-kilogram bomb tore through the vessel and exploded in the sea before the aircraft struck the flight deck and started a fire.  30 seconds later, Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa (also flying a Zero fighter) repeated the same attack, dropping his 250-kilogram bomb, which ignited aviation fuel, before plunging into the flight deck near the control tower.  The two <i>kamikaze</i> special attacks killed 373 men aboard USS Bunker Hill and wounded 264 more.  Badly damaged, she limped back to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for repairs.  When she re-emerged from the shipyard in Sep 1945, the war was already over.  Her last active duty mission was Operation Magic Carpet in which she brought home troops from the Pacific.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>While being on the decommissioned reserve list, USS Bunker Hill was re-classified several times.  In May 1959, her final re-classification named her an auxiliary aircraft landing training vessel (AVT).  She was used as a stationary electronics test platform in the 1960s and early 1970s, and was sold for scrap in May 1973.</p>

The way the story goes is that they had to chain the ship together to get it back to port. Also after one of the planes hit the deck one of the Japanese pilots, didn't say how much of the pilot, landed on the deck away from the explosion. The pilot was wearing a large diamond ring. One of the upper officers saw this and tried removing the ring and was not successful. So he whip out his knife and removed the finger from the pilot and then removed the ring from the finger. Put it in his pocket and went on his way. That's how I heard it. My grand fathers name was Cole Gammon.

He was a radioman / radio operator at the time of the major kamikaze attack.  We have a video taped radio interview of him discussing that horrible day in his history.  Roger was a writer and reflected some of his memories, which were translated and published in a Japanese veterans publication.  Roger wrote a book on his time at Farragut Naval Station, Idaho. There had been annual September reunions until a couple of years ago at the lake. Roger's publication remains available at their museum / gift shop.  Roger was an honorable soldier, veteran, father and grandfather.  He passed away in June of 2002 and is buried at Fort Snelling Cemetary in Minneapolis Minnesota.  His widow, Carol Glans, resides in Everett, Washington (formerly Plymouth Minnesota) along with Roger's eldest son and family.

His name was Frank (Jake)Handzlik and his nickname was Lucky. He was a tailgunner and a radioman. He had just come in from a mission and was in bed when everything started to happen. He took the time to put on a pair of pants before he headed to his safe station. When he got there he was told it was full and he left... all the men in that safe station were killed. I think that ate at him for the rest of his life.

I am a historian with the Navy History and Heritage Command (NHHC) in Washington DC. I am currently researching and writing a ship's history of USS Bunker Hill (CV-17) for inclusion in our Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS). I will unfortunately never be able to tell the story of every brave sailor, airman, and Marine that served aboard, but if anyone has any information they can provide me such as a diary, journal, letter, or other primary source material, especially concerning the sinking of the battleship Yamato and/or the kamikaze strikes and aftermath, I would be very grateful. Veterans especially, I am hoping to hear from you about your experiences onboard Bunker Hill! Please contact me at guy.nasuti@navy.mil or guy.nasuti@gmail.com. </div><div id='commentItem93' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>93. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Jackie Evans</span> says:<br /><small>27 Jul 2016 07:42:31 PM</small><br /><br />I have information on Radioman, Barney Garland Neal, killed on the USS Bunker Hill in 1945 that includes photos, his Purple Heart, sympathy letters from President Truman and Cpt. H.L. Meadow, Commander, Cemetery information, birth dates/city.  As the Uncle I never met but is the reason I joined the Navy, I would love to get his name and particulars added.  Would someone please contact me for this information?

His name was Ernest Alonzo Findley, Sr. of Viewtown, Va., and died at the age 84 in 2010.  He was born on February 21, 1926 in Elbert, W.Va, and lied about his age to enlist in the US Navy.  "He was too young".  He received the Presidential Unit Citation and eleven silver stars for his service.  Nice man, very talented too.  Anyone know of him. I can not find him on any google search for the ship manifest or books on the Bunker Hill.  Just love to know more.

Muster Rolls for USS Bunker Hill list Seaman 2nd class Ernest A Findley as a plank-owner in May 1943 and the Oct 1945 Muster Roll still lists him as part of the crew, by this time as a Boatswains Mate 2nd class. Bunker Hill (and all members of her crew & attached air group) indeed were awarded a Presidential Unit Citation but 11 Silver Stars sounds a little high - Bunker Hill (and all members of her crew & attached air groups) earned 11 Battle Stars in WWII, which is still pretty impressive.</div><div id='commentItem103' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>103. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Anoymous</span> says:<br /><small>6 Jan 2017 05:20:00 PM</small><br /><br />I spoke with a man today who was on the USS Bunker Hill.How amazing it was to listen to this Hero!

Hope he doesn't mind me telling his name but it was James Farr. Mr Farr it was truly an honor to speak with you!
