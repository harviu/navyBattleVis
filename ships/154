Before WW2, she operated in a variety of missions, including participation in fleet problems, training in anti-aircraft gunnery, and visiting foreign ports in Latin America, South Pacific, and Australia.  When the European War began in Sep 1939, she was on a cruise in South America.  While in Brazil, she was diverted to South Africa to pick up British gold worth US$148 million for transportation to New York City, United States; she was given this duty because a British ship traveling across the Atlantic Ocean would risk attacks from German submarines and put the valuable cargo at risk.  An American ship, however, would be protected by her mother country's neutrality.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>When the United States officially entered the war in Dec 1941, Louisville was on an escorting mission from the Caribbean Sea to Hawaii.  In Feb and Mar 1942, she escorted carriers when they raided Japanese bases in Gilbert, Marshall, and Solomon Islands areas.  She spent some time in the Aleutian Islands area before being sent back to South Pacific for the closing stages of the Guadalcanal Campaign.  On 29 Jan 1943, she participated in the Battle of Rennell Island, where she was hit by a dud torpedo and after the battle towed cruiser Chicago until tug Navajo took over the job.  In Apr 1943, she returned to the Aleutian Islands as a part of Task Force 16.  In the North Pacific, she covered the assault and occupation of Attu Island from 11 to 30 May and then the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska in Aug 1943.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>After the overhaul, Louisville was tasked with providing pre-landing naval gunfire support at Wotje, Kwajalein and Eniwetok atolls in the Marshall Islands between Jan and Feb 1944, while flying the flag of Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf.  She escorted carriers during Central Pacific raids in Mar 1944 and bombarded Japanese positions Truk and Sawatan in Apr 1944.  In Jun and Jul, she bombarded Saipan, Tinian, and Guam.  After the Mariana Islands action, she retired to the rear area until mid-Sep.  In Sep and Oct, she bombarded Peleliu and Leyte, respectively.  In the night of 24 to 25 Oct, she participated in the Battle of the Surigao Strait where the large surface action resulted in heavy losses for the Japanese Navy.  After the Leyte actions, she rejoined the fast carriers as a part of Task Force 38, and attacked Japanese positions on the shores of Luzon.  On 5 and 6 Jan 1945, Louisville was struck by two <i>Kamikaze</i> special attack aircraft while supporting American operations in the Philippine Islands.  She remained in the area briefly to complete her shore bombardment mission, and then was withdrawn to Mare Island Navy Yard in the United States for permanent repairs.  She returned to the war in May 1945 with Task Force 54 to provide naval gunfire support during the Okinawa Campaign, where she was once again hit by a suicide aircraft on 5 Jun; after temporary repairs, she was back on the firing line by 9 Jun, but departed for Pearl Harbor for permanent repairs a week later.  She was at Pearl Harbor when the war ended.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Louisville left Pearl Harbor on 15 Aug 1945 and headed back for post-war operations.  She supervised the rescue of Allied POWs in Manchuria and then witnessed the surrender of Japanese vessels by Vice Admiral Kaneko in Tsingtao.  She remained off the Chinese coast until Oct 1945.  Louisville was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in the United States in Jun 1946.  She was sold to the Marlene Blouse Corporation of New York for scrap on 14 Sep 1959.</p>

He was a petty officer, first class, gunners mate. The good LORD took him on November 27, 1982. Thanks to him and many others we live in a free country! Let us not forget the sacrifices these veterans made so that we can live the life we now live.

He was telling me about it tonight.  Told me about the Kamikaze attacks hitting the turret and then the bridge.  Im sure he knew the above mentioned sailors.

I will present him with a Louisville cap on the 18th of Feb at the nursing home where he now lives.  He is a good man and I honor and respect him.</div><div id='commentItem5' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>5. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Anonymous</span> says:<br /><small>13 May 2009 03:40:30 PM</small><br /><br />My uncle LaVerne "Louie" was aboard the USS Louisville when it was attacked by the kamikaze planes.  He said they had to go to shore for 4 days while they fixed the turret.  He has a book called Man Of War, with a lot of pictures and details of the USS Louisville.  God bless our soldiers for the frightening, demanding lives they live, all for the service to our country.  Without them, we would have nothing.   My uncle turned 90 April 2, 2009 and his mind is still as sharp as a tack.  He remembers everything and everyone on the USS Louisville, and even explained to me what all the switches were to run the ship.  An amazing man from an amazing era.  The world needs more like him.</div><div id='commentItem6' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>6. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Daughter of Marty Martinson</span> says:<br /><small>2 Jul 2009 03:36:43 PM</small><br /><br />My Dad, who died when I was a child, was a gunner's mate on the Louisville.

The January '45 Kamikaze attack and resulting repairs at Mare Island (near San Francisco) allowed my aunt to be conceived. He passed away on Thanksgiving day 2001. I miss him.</div><div id='commentItem8' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>8. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Proud Grandson </span> says:<br /><small>27 Dec 2009 06:03:04 PM</small><br /><br />There is so many unwritten stories about this ship and its crew surrounding the events in the pacific.... I fear that one day they will be forgotten... These men fought for our very existence as Americans. They seen things things in there 20's that most 20 year old American men today can not imagine..... My wish and hope is that there story is told before it is forgotten. The events of of the Louisville in the pacific will be pasted down to my sons and grandson..but what about the rest America.

He worked in the radar area. He would tell us stories of the War. He has passed on now. My grandson is now studing about WWII. I have some of Dad's things from the war that he can share with his classmates. I am proud of all those that served in the war and of all of you that want to keep all your memories alive of your love one that served during the wars.</div><div id='commentItem10' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>10. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Jeff Limon</span> says:<br /><small>27 Apr 2010 06:55:01 PM</small><br /><br />I believe that man named Steve Ligurtsky was on the USS Louisville.  He was to marry my aunt Mercedes in the early 1940s.  She died of tuberculosis while Steve was away.  Steve came looking for when he was on shore leave around 1942.  He was upset in that no one told him of the death of his fiancée.  He asked my dad "Why didn't you tell me?".  My dad told him that he sent a letter, but the letter apparently never reached Steve, given that he was out there in the South Pacific.

Steve returned to his post on the Louisville, and was killed a few months later as a result of a kamikaze attack.

Sincerely

Williams was on the USS Louisville from 41 to 45. He was a Store Keeper. He never spoke of the war. After he passed I found all his Navy items, 2 journals of his daily life happenings on the Louie. The crew of this ship are truely all HEROS. I salute them all. I have the Man of War book and the medal given the ship for delivering the gold to New York in preparing for the war. Michael Harsche living in Bremerton also served and wrote a book on the Louie. I praise all the fine men of the USS LOUISVILLE. They are truly America's Hero's.

He often told of the night the Louisville towed the Chicago all night at a slow speed under kamikaze fire. Until he passed away in March 2002, he always said he'd never forget the sound that the kamikazes made. He also served in the boiler rooms on the USS Saratoga, the USS Midway, the USS Lexington, and the USS Oriskany. 20 years active duty.

He passed on 6-22-12 at age 93.  The USS Louisville was one of his greatest sources of pride.  A week before his death he was showing a visitor his photo journal: showing the wonderful companionship aboard the ship as well as some of the more auspicious moments (the sinking of the Graf Spee and Good Will Tour of South America).  He had so many stories:  the rescue of passengers from a capsized ferry in Sydney Harbor, the torpedo that banged around ominously in the hull while they limped back to Pearl and the guys that died when they had to seal off to save the rest of the ship.  He greatly respected his shipmates and thought highly of Admiral Leighton for putting the safety of his crew ahead of seeking glory in battles.  I am proud of my Dad and proudly call myself a USS Louisville "descendent."</div><div id='commentItem24' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>24. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Dan Maple</span> says:<br /><small>23 Sep 2012 08:45:36 PM</small><br /><br />Dear Sirs & family,

If anyone would be willing to share their fathers/grandfathers pictures with us (through scanning), I would be absolutely grateful. My e-mail is jessie.l.freeman25@gmail.com, and you can add me on facebook with jessie.l.freeman@korea.army.mil I'll be surprising him for Veteran's day, but even if you contact me after that, please please do.

Previously he had served on the US Dedee.  After his suiside, a result of the fear of his Alzhimer desease, I found a map in his effects.  It documents every day of his service while on the Louisville from the leaving Pearl Harbor on Augus 16 to his arrival at San Francisco on Nov. 10.  Although he never talked about his time spent in World War II, he was always proud of his duty to his country.  The posts on this site make me even more proud of his time serving in the South Pacific from 1942 to 1945.  He was from Staunton, Virginia.</div><div id='commentItem29' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>29. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Daniel Holder</span> says:<br /><small>21 May 2014 01:35:15 PM</small><br /><br />If you read this or can provide ANY ITEM or copy or comment for historical record contribution for CA-28, PLS contact me regarding archives I am promoting to grow for the ship at U of Louisville in Louisville, KY.

He picked fragments of kamikaze that hit the bridge killing 41 sailors. I still have those fragments. Admiral Theodore Chandler died of his wounds the next day along with his orderly, marine Joseph Siegel. 
USS  Louisville was also hit by two other Kamikazes, one bouncing off the hull and the other hit a turret. Neither of these attacks took any lives or caused any crippling damage. My dad said the paint was a bit scratched.
My grandfather served in WWI and was mustard gassed in France. He spent 20 years in and out of the VA  hospital in Chicago  . I served in the Navy reserves from Dec 7, 1971 - Aug 12, 1977.</div><div id='commentItem31' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>31. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Anonymous</span> says:<br /><small>6 Jun 2014 09:33:48 AM</small><br /><br />Thank you Len Balasa Jr for responding and sending the fragment pics.  The return address on your email was not a visible email address to me.  I replied to that anyway in case it might reach you.  Anyone sending me email about the history of this ship, please make sure your email address will be visible to me so that I can reply.  If I have not replied to you within a 7-10 days (I might be out of town) PLEASE contact me again.  I WILL respond to you! I am interested in getting copies of any and all documents or pics, etc to a logical place for public access, at the Univ of Louisville Archives.  Most crew members have already passed away.

He was a gunner on one of the large guns and narrowly avoided death in the Kamikaze attacks. He has recently shared more remembrances about the war, something he has rarely done.

He saw them pop up or his screen but apparently the range it was saying they were at was further out than the technology was suppose to be able to detect he told someone and they brushed it off as feedback. Once they received a call from the Australian navy that they had bogies heading their way, they took action. It was a rough day for everyone. My heart goes out to the families that were affected.</div><div id='commentItem49' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>49. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Lora Green</span> says:<br /><small>9 May 2016 08:35:47 PM</small><br /><br />My dad Lewis Claxon served on Lady Lou during WWII and was a radar man. He was drafted into the war. He had just came off watch and was on deck when the kamikaze plane hit. He was very badly wounded but managed to make it out of the war. He will be 91 on the 11th this month. He like some others didn't make it home with all his things. But he does have the war book and I managed to get his medals that he didn't receive, replaced and gave to him on his 80th birthday. He needless to say overwhelmed. I look often to try to find anything I can find that came from or has any markings of the Louisville. He would love to hear from any shipmates still living. He has 3 friends locally that were also on the ship. If anyone is interested in speaking to him email me at basketlover_98@yahoo.com. I loved reading everyone's stories. </div><div id='commentItem50' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>50. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Minerich</span> says:<br /><small>8 Sep 2016 07:58:58 AM</small><br /><br />my father John E Minerich served on the Loisville and was wounded during a kamikazi attack by one of the turrets, he will be 90 this september. the greatest generation ever!</div><div id='commentItem51' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>51. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Courtney </span> says:<br /><small>22 Nov 2016 08:53:00 PM</small><br /><br />My grandfather Domingo Alvarez (95) passed away last night, he served on this ship in the engine room.  :( </div><div id='commentItem52' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>52. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Glenn</span> says:<br /><small>13 Feb 2017 06:56:11 PM</small><br /><br />My father served on the USS Louisville also in the engine room I look at the man of war book quite often</div><div id='commentItem53' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>53. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Glenn</span> says:<br /><small>13 Feb 2017 07:02:10 PM</small><br /><br />My father served on the USS Louisville during World War II he also was in the engine room his name was Ernest Washim also known as Tex</div><div id='commentItem54' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>54. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Jim Gleason</span> says:<br /><small>15 Mar 2017 01:26:09 PM</small><br /><br />My father also served in the Engine Room on the Louisville during WWII - he was a Chief Petty Officer.

I am trying to piece together the years, but I think in  the 1943-45 range. He survived at least 2 kamikaze attacks. I believe he was a helmsman. Although he never spoke of the war until he was in his eighties, he did tell a story of refueling where he didn't do such a great steering job! He was expecting to get severely reprimanded, but didn't. As a kid, I remember seeing a pair of hand held signaling flags, maybe red and yellowy-orange and the book numerous others have mentioned. I don't know what happened to them. He passed away at 85 yrs old in 2005. He was a good man and I miss him.  He was interviewed by a local newspaper reporter in 2001.
