Her design plans were based upon Japan's belief that a powerful navy sporting big guns were the key to control the Pacific by intimidation.  Based on this philosophy, naval designer Captain Kikuo Fujimoto gave the original 1934 design of the Yamato nine 18.1 inch guns, and made the hull versatile enough to be re-armed for larger guns later.  Her massive guns dwarfed all other guns used in naval warfare, with each turret weighing as much as a typical American destroyer.  Unlike the American battleships whose width were limited due to the Panama Canal restriction, the Yamato had the freedom to be equipped with some of the thickest armor on her two sides for unsurpassed protection.  Her bow was also of a special design, allowing this heavy hulk of a ship to travel up little above 27 knots.  When Naoyoshi Ishida, an officer who served aboard the Yamato, first saw her, he thought "How huge it is!"  He recalled:</p>
<dir>
"When you walk inside, there are arrows telling you which direction is the front and which is the backotherwise you can't tell. For a couple of days I didn't even know how to get back to my own quarters. Everyone was like that....  I knew it was a very capable battleship. The guns were enormous. Back then I really wanted to engage in battle with an American battleship in the Pacific."
</dir>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Because of her enormous size, men who served aboard reported that there was no pitch or roll when sailing, even when standing at the top of the command tower.  It was almost as if they were standing on firm ground, recalled Ensign Mitsuru Yoshida who served on the Yamato as a radar officer.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Her construction, started after a few iterations of design changes and refinements, was shielded in a veil of secrecy.  With inadequate resources spent on military intelligence, the United States had no clue of her existence when she was commissioned in Dec 1941, a week after the start of the Pacific War.  Yamato served as flagship of Combined Fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto until his death in Apr 1943.  Several reasons kept her unable to fire her 2,998lb shells on enemy ships; beyond being the flagship of Japan's naval commander, she was only too valuable to engage in battle.  A ship bearing the mythical name of ancient Japan simply could not be risked.  As a result, she remained near the naval base of Truk for the most of 1943 on defensive duty.  During a patrol in Dec 1943, she was damaged by torpedo launched from USS Skate (SS-305), further reducing her roles on the frontlines.  She finally saw action during later stages of the war, participating in actions in the Philippines Sea, then as the command ship of Admiral Takeo Kurita devastated a small American fleet off Samar (though Yamato did not play a significantly active role in the Battle off Samar).</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Besides the usual explosive and armor-piercing shells, Yamato was equipped with a unique anti-aircraft shell for use with the 18.1 inch main guns.  The <i>sanshiki</i> shells weighed just under 3,000 pounds, and were filled with incendiary tubes.  These anti-aircraft shells were fired toward incoming aircrafts a la flak, and a timed fuse triggered an explosion in the path of the hostile aircrafts, filling the air space with burning steel shrapnel.  In addition to these unique shells, Yamato was also surrounded by a wide array of traditional anti-aircraft weapons at the base of the superstructure.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>While in home waters after the winter 1944-1945 refitting (more anti-aircraft weapons), she was spotted and attacked by U.S. Navy carrier planes in March 1945.  She escaped with light damage, but her vulnerability against the swarming American aircrafts was now clear.  With the war effort in its most desperate time, she was assigned a month later to become the ultimate suicidal special attack instrument in the Ten-Go (Ten'ichigo) Operation.  The operation called for a suicide mission of ten ships to sail straight into the American fleet supporting the Okinawa landing.  If she was not able to sail into the American fleet, she was to beach herself on Okinawa to serve as a mighty coastal fortress while the sailors disembark to become infantry.  If that failed, she then was to draw as much fire from American aircraft as possible so that a concurrent suicide operation by <i>Kamikaze</i> aircraft (Operation Kikusui) would confront less resistance from the air.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>At 1220 on 7 Apr 1945, while still some 270 miles north of Okinawa, after being tracked by American reconnaissance aircraft and submarines almost the entire way, Yamato was attacked by waves and waves of American carrier planes.  She received serious damage from falling bombs within the first 15 minutes of the battle, then was struck by torpedoes on the port side.  Her strategy was to contain the damage and flooding and wait for American aircraft to dissipate.  But as more waves arrive to attack at the task force, that hope quickly proved unreachable.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>After an agonizing two hours, the largest battleship in the world sank as the list reached nearly 90 degrees.  She then exploded twice under water; the cause of the explosion was likely the shells from the primary and secondary magazines falling off their shelves and detonating their fuses against the overhead.  Only 269 men survived the sinking super battleship.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>After the war, Yamato became an object of intense fascination in Japan, as well as in foreign countries.  She also remained a sensitive topic in Japan.  While still a token of national pride, the sinking of Yamato also symbolized the sad end of the once invincible Imperial Japanese Navy.  Yamato's remains were located and examined in 1985 and again examined, more precisely, in 1999.  She lies in two main parts in some 1,000 feet of water.  Her bow portion, severed from the rest of the ship in the vicinity of the second main battery turret, is upright, and the 2-meter wide chrysanthemum crest still glowing in a faint golden aura.  The midships and stern section is upside down nearby, with two large holes in the bottom section of the ship, the result of powerful internal explosions.</p>

IJN Musashi (BB) was lost on 10-24-45 in Sibuyan Sea, within CLOSE Site of Land Mass ISLAND to PORT of ship...close.
IJN Shinano, on way to KURE sinks # 33-07*N, 137-04*E...go find them too.

But I remember that it cost us 23 TBMs with the lives of 69 aircrews, small,of course, compared with concurrent loss of Japanese sailors, but that is not the point

By great, I mean due to its size, armaments, firepower, number of crew and armor protection. Not so much though for sea battles won since it only sunk hapless and helpless escort carriers and destroyer escorts in a running battle. How ironic that Japan which ushered in the might of air power (Pearl Harbor, Sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse[?]) came to see its sea power decimated by American and Allied air power and its beautiful cities bombed to ashes. There are no victors in war for it only leaves  widespread destruction, widows and orphans, famine, chaos and disorder.   </div><div id='commentItem27' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>27. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Andy McGeechan</span> says:<br /><small>18 Jan 2011 04:47:46 AM</small><br /><br />

"Why would the Japanese tell the German admiral that the main guns are only 40 cm? Aren't they supposed to be allies back then?"

The Japanese Military régime did not trust the Germans, despite receiving lots of technology from them (via Submarine transport missions)
This may stem from the fact that, as Europeans, they where little different from  the the rest of the imperialist westerners whom they wished to throw out of their "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"(1938) and mixed feelings about Germany signing a pact with the USSR, even though Japan itself to resort to a similar. agreement by 1941</div><div id='commentItem28' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>28. <span style='font-style: italic;'>CliSwe</span> says:<br /><small>6 Sep 2011 03:23:07 AM</small><br /><br />Quite an awe-inspiring ship. Seriously though, she was obsolete as soon as she commissioned - and the new breed in the IJN knew it. Only the old-school admirals saw her as a viable combat asset.

  you don't understand naval amphibious assaults....the carriers go first, to soften up the target area, and to destroy any enemy craft (air or sea), in the area...the destroyers, cruisers, and battleships then escort the assault ships in, conducting a prelanding bombardment, and  support during landing operations. If the heavies had been 100 miles in front of the carriers, they would have probably been lost to midway based aircraft, since they would have been operating without air cover. :D

The spec on the big guns are off by a decimal place.  The Main guns (9) were 460 cm not 46 cm looking at the rest and I'm going to say they are really messed up too.  e.g. the 6 15.5 cm were 155 cm I believe  162x25mm, really??

I dont think there is a decimal point issue here so much as there is a centimeter vs. millimeter issue here. The specifications listed for the Yamatos armaments are correct. The bore of the 9 main guns was 46 cm or 460 mm and certainly not 460 cm (that would be 15 feet!). Similarly, the bore of the 6 secondary guns was 15.5 cm or 155 mm and not 155 cm (5 feet). And, Yes; 162x25mm, really. 25 mm is roughly 1 inch and was a pretty standard anti-aircraft caliber for all nations.</div><div id='commentItem41' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>41. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Kemp Gibson</span> says:<br /><small>18 Sep 2017 03:08:32 PM</small><br /><br />I am the son of Lt William K 
Gibson Jr, one of the pilots of Torpedo Squadron Nine that finished off the Yamato in 1945.

I have an autographed photograph of seven squadron members, including Thomas Stetson, that I wish to submit to someone for its historic significance.

Is this something you would be interested in receiving or do you know someone or some organization that would like to have it?

I can send it via email if provided with an email address.

Thank you.</div><div id='commentItem42' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>42. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Joseph FP Harty </span> says:<br /><small>18 Jan 2018 01:31:32 AM</small><br /><br />Read this book about 10 years ago about a US sub that caught this Japanese behemoth 70,000 ton Yamato running at night with a skelton amatuar crew with a light escort. The story went that after being repaired from severe aerial attacks the harbor it was at was no longer able to protect it. So they took a scram [WWII slang for bugging out ] to get to another safer port and the sub had it's torpedos run near the surface, as the belt around it was set up for normal deep running torpedo attacks. This book was published with the commanders consent, any you Navy historians read this book?<br /></div><div id='commentItem43' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>43. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Joseph F Harty</span> says:<br /><small>18 Jan 2018 06:16:12 PM</small><br /><br />Kemp Gibson so did one sub take this behemoth out, or was the book I read pure bull?  Wish I could remember the captions name am going to go through all my books, sure that one was kept, it was almost a like a sit-rip.</div><div id='commentItem44' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>44. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Kaleb Ross</span> says:<br /><small>22 Jan 2018 09:55:18 AM</small><br /><br />actually, the submarine you are talking about was the uss skate, which fired i think 1 or 2 and one of those torpedoes hit the Yamato, badly damaging the ship and make out of action for a few months</div><small><p>All visitor submitted comments are opinions of those making the submissions and do not reflect views of WW2DB.</p></small>	<script>
