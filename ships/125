She arrived in New York, United States on 16 Aug 1931 to become the flagship of US Navy's Cruisers, Scouting Force; she remained in that role until 1940, serving on both of the United States' coasts.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in Dec 1941, Chicago was at sea with Task Force 12 nearby, and was dispatched to intercept the Japanese fleet; Task Force 12 returned to Pearl Harbor without finding the Japanese fleet on 12 Dec.  In Mar and Apr 1942, she served off the eastern tip of New Guinea, covering the attacks on Lae and Salamaua.  On 4 May, she escorted carrier Yorktown on the air raid against Tulagi.  On 7 May, she sailed to intercept the Japanese invasion fleet aiming for Port Moresby, and the ensuing engagement with Japanese aircraft formed the small side-battle in the greater Battle of Coral Sea.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>On the night of 31 May 1942, Japanese Navy Lieutenant Katsuhisa Ban and Petty Officer Mamoru Ashibe piloted the midget submarine M-24 around the defensive nets in the Sydney Harbor and fired two torpedoes at USS Chicago moored off the inner-city locality of Garden Island of Sydney, Australia; the torpedoes missed Chicago, but one of them struck Australian accommodation vessel Kuttabull, killing 19 Australians and 2 Britons.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>Starting on 7 Aug, Chicago provided gunfire support for the initial landings on the island of Guadalcanal, which place her in the middle of the Battle of Savo Island on 9 Aug, where she sustained a torpedo hit and several shell hits.  She engaged the Japanese bravely, but she (along with all other ships in the southern group) committed a grave mistake by not warning the northern group nearby of the presence of a Japanese attacking force, resulting in a disaster for the Allied fleet that night.  She received repairs at Nouméa, Sydney, and San Francisco for much of the remainder of the year.</p>
<p><span style='font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;'> ww2dbase</span>In Jan 1943, Chicago departed from San Francisco for the South Pacific.  On 27 Jan, she sailed from Nouméa to escort a convoy to Guadalcanal.  Some time in the afternoon of 29 Jan, American radar operators of Rear Admiral Robert Giffen's Task Force 18 detected unidentified aircraft, but they failed to report up the chain of command for proper action.  The unidentified aircraft were 31 Japanese torpedo bombers.  That evening, they found Giffen's two escort carriers, three heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers 50 miles north of Rennell Island, and launched a torpedo attack.  At 1938 and 1945, two torpedoes from two separate aircraft in the third wave of attack hit Chicago at port bow and then on starboard side.  She was crippled by 2000.  The damage control team controlled the fires, allowing her to be towed first by cruiser Louisville and then tug Navajo.  At 1540 in the next afternoon, however, Japanese aircraft returned and delivered four lethal torpedoes.  Captain Ralph Davis of USS Chicago evacuated his ship in about 20 minutes, and a few moments after the last of the 1,049 survivors left the ship, she sank stern first.</p>

My brother-in-law, Glenn Faulk, was one of the 1049 survivors. He will be 90 years old in October 2009 and lives in Memphis, TN. He has talked very little about his experiences and his family did not know details of this Battle.

Greene, served on the Chicago during WWII as a Radioman Second Class in the Pacific theater.  (He also served on a sub chaser and maybe a tender.)  He is eight five now, and in addition to senile dementia, he's had a closed head injury resulting in some permanent brain damage.  His memories of his time in the Navy are gone, and my sister and I are hoping to find someone who knew him who could remember for him, for us. </div><div id='commentItem5' class='commentItem' style='background-color: #f0f0f0'>5. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Gary L.

He come back to his home in Illinois and started his family.  I am the oldest of his two sons.  He loved the Navy and his country very much.  He didnt really talk much about his time in the Navy and his tour of duty in the Pacific.  However, he did write a book several years before he died at the age of 73.  The family was so proud of him and how he served his country in the American way.  We still have his Navy picture sitting on the mantel at our home.  What a young man done so much for his country.  After the war was over and he got to come home he always flew the American flag at his house and to this day I still fly the American flag everyday just like he tought me to be proud of our country.  What a great country country we have, thanks to all of our veterns.

I've been given a US Navy sailor's cap with the name J.H. COULTER written inside the cap. I was told that this man was on the USS Chicago and was KIA in the Coral Sea Battle in 1942. Trying to find how to confirm that this man was KIA. Can anyone tell me how to do this. There is a lovely story to this. This man and my mother were in love and were to marry after WWII.  I have a photo of him as well. If I can find the family of this man, I would like to return the cap to them.  Any assistance would be very greatfully received.

He said the decks of the rescue ship were steel instead of wood like the Chicago and recalls how hot the deck was when he climbed up the cargo net and walked across it for the first time in bare feet.  He was reassigned to a supply ship out of Sydney for a year hauling supplies to Midway and wounded soldiers back to Australia for medical treatment.

he went on to Noumea and the USS Guam.

Following the sinking of the Chicago, Captain Ralph Davis did receive heavy criticism but more so the commanding Admiral, Robert Giffen. Both survived the scathing and went on to have useful careers through to the end of the war. So far as I know, neither committed suicide.

The story where the Captain was disgraced and committed suicide sounds more like Captain Charles Butler McVay III, captain of the cruiser USS Indianapolis at the time of her sinking in 1945. He was treated abysmally by the Navy, being the only ships captain in US Naval history to be formally court martialed for losing his ship in combat. Years later, he shot himself. Years after that in 2000, he was formally cleared of all wrongdoing by a Special Act of Congress. This action by Congress was brought about in no small way by a 12-year-old Florida schoolboy whose curiosity over the incident was raised by the character 'Quint' telling the Indianapolis story in the movie 'Jaws.'</div><div id='commentItem34' class='commentItem' style='background-color: '>34. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Terry Popravak</span> says:<br /><small>15 Jul 2016 11:37:27 AM</small><br /><br />     The disgraced captain mentioned above (comment 32) may be a reference to Captain Howard D. Bode, USN, who was relieved of command of Chicago after the ship returned to the US from the Pacific after being damaged in the disastrous Battle of Savo Island, 9 August 1943.  Reassigned to shore duty in Panama, he unfortunately took his own life in April of 1943 after he learned he was to be officially censured for his conduct during the Savo Island battle.

At the time of the attack, Chicago was indeed assigned to the fleet at Pearl Harbor, but her role that particular day was at sea escorting the carrier Lexington to Midway Island. Chicago was 800 miles away from Pearl Harbor during the actual attack. After receiving word of the attack, Chicago and the rest of her Task Group immediately began sweeping the seas for the Japanese fleet, but without success. Your fathers role was no less important by these facts nor is he any less of a survivor, but this is where Chicago was that day.</div><small><p>All visitor submitted comments are opinions of those making the submissions and do not reflect views of WW2DB.</p></small>	<script>
